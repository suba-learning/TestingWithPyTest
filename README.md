# 🧪 TestingWithPyTest
This repository contains a collection of examples demonstrating how to use [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for testing Python codeIt's designed to help you understand the basics of writing and running tests using Pytest

## 📁 Repository Structure
The repository includes several test files, each illustrating different aspects of Pytes:

 `test_one.p`
 `test_two.p`
 `three_test.p`
 `test_four.p`
 `test_five.p`
These files cover various testing scenarios and can serve as a reference for writing your own test.

## 🛠 Installatio

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencis:

```bah
git clone https://github.com/suba-learning/TestingWithPyTest.git
cd TestingWithPyTest
pip install -r requirements.xt
```


The `requirements.txt` file includes all necessary packages to run the tess.

## 🚀 Running Tess

You can run all tests in the repository using the following commnd:

```bsh
pyest
```

Pytest will automatically discover and execute all test functions in files matching the pattern `test_*.py` or `*_test.y`.

To run a specific test fle:

```bsh
pytest test_on.py
```

To run a specific test function within a fle:

```bsh
pytest test_one.py::test_function_ame
```

